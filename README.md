The current poison system is verry vaige so thease are some idea i have;
Making poisons should be done IC when possible but also in your Downtime if you are gone for a while.

To make poisons you will need herbalism for stage 1-2 and pharmacy for the rest, plus the requirments on the guide.

Poisons effects,
We have a [url=http://www.shinobistoryonline.com/topic227.html]Guide[/url] on it but i want to expand on it a little, Poisons should have visible ic effects and not be instant to stop instant killing e.g. I deiced to poison lady toa in combat with a high level poison i just cant kill her with it i need effects and stages,
Stage 1, She gets blurred vision this will start 3-5 turns after person is poisoned
Stage 2 Looses control of a random limb, (Could be rolled for by either party or decided) turns 5-7 
stage 3 She looses control of her body turns 7-8 
stage 4 death, turn 9-10

Using poison,
First you must land a blow or have them eat it Ic,(Like the poisoned apple from snow white.) after that they must roll to see if they know that they are poisond E.g. the apple is bitter or the water taysts off. When fighting if they have a sensory perk like eyesight to see the weapon being coated it somthing or smell to smell it Duh.

Holding poison, For now you should only have two poisons each with two uses then a couple day cooldown(Ignore this if you are poisoning yourself, E.g. suiside.
In the futer we could have perks to increase the amount and lower the time of making.
Cures,
You are the only person with the True cure but you can give it to others Icly. It would take 1-2 turns to stop any posions affects (Other than death). With poison fighter one you can stop the effects but you and the person are rooted and cant do any attacks that requires hands seals or moving the body. if you or the person moves the poison is activated and a 1 turn cool down before you can try again.
Poison fighter two can stop all flow of the poison but the victim is knocked out.
After the fight PF1 will stop the flow but the person is knocked and the docter must stay with the person
PF2 will cure after a while of RP.
